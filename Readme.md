# How to combine the layout of multiple controls in a single file

Starting with version **14.2**. we support [Workspace Manager](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/17674/Controls-and-Libraries/Form-Layout-Managers/Workspace-Manager) that provides a centralized mechanism to save/restore layouts of multiple our controls to a single stream or file. Refer to the [How to use WorkspaceManager for capturing, applying, saving and loading workspaces](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-use-workspacemanager-for-capturing-applying-saving-and-loading-workspaces-t190543) example to learn how to use this component.
